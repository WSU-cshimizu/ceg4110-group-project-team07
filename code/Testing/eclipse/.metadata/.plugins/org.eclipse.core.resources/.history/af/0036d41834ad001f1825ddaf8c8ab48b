Feature: About Page Functionality
  As a user,
  I want to view information about GeoSyncra on the About page
  So that I can understand its purpose and functionality.

  Scenario: Display About page correctly
    Given I am on the About page
    Then I should see the title "GeoSyncra"
    And I should see the "About" section with its content
    And I should see a navigation bar with links to other pages
    And the clock should display the current time
    And I should see a placeholder image

  Scenario: Navigation links work
    Given I am on the About page
    When I click on the "Viewpage" link
    Then I should be redirected to the "randomImages.html" page

    When I click on the "Upload" link
    Then I should be redirected to the "upload.html" page

    When I click on the "Home" link
    Then I should be redirected to the "index.html" page
