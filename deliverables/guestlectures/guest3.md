## Pertinent Questions


## Lessons Learned

Communication between and within teams is necessary for success. Communication between business and technology people often fails when terminology is different. The business side may want something, and the technology people interpret the same words differently. Lack of planning and changes in business processes or what the customer wants can also cause communication issues. This issue can be resolved with more aggressive planning, discussion, and clarification between groups.
