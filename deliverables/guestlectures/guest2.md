## Pertinent Questions
* By following a results driven approach, do certain parts of the design process be overlooked? For instance, as discussed in the lecture, if you are pushing out applications in five days, are you bypassing testing or preparation of design documents in favor of prioritizing software development?

* Question 2

## Lessons Learned
Speed of relevancy > Solutions are only viable if they are still relevant to the problem/question. If a solution takes longer to implement than it takes the issue to get out of hand, it is not a viable solution. These guys try to implement solutions in five days in order to avoid complacency and to make sure the solution is not out of date by the time it is finished.
