# Project Requirements

Should not define how it is to be built. Which could lead to an implementation that prevents meeting performance or other requirements. Consider, locking in a specific framework, but also locking in specific requirements related to latency that the framework cannot meet.

## System Requirements
Here are some of the requirments we wrote a couple weeks ago but i reworded them to fit the format of requirements better:
- User data, images, likes, comments, and geolocation information shall be stored in a database.
- The system will integrate with a mapping service to display the photo's location.
