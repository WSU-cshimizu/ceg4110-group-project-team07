## Lessons Learned 
The lecturers introduced Kanban as an alternative methodology to the traditional Agile methods we’ve focused on in class, such as Scrum. While Kanban is part of the Agile family, I wasn’t familiar with it before this presentation and hadn’t considered it as an option. The presentation highlighted Kanban’s emphasis on continuous workflow, making it ideal for seeing a project through to completion without the time constraints of a two-week sprint. This contrasts with Scrum, where work may not be fully completed within a sprint and can require further iterations.

Bugs can be prioritized by impact on the final product, time invested, and cost. People tend to assume their stuff is most important since it has a more direct effect on them, so it is important to make sure the whole team is communicating issues and being as open and objective about what is/is not important as possible. Requests might be prioritized by who makes the request, like a client or company owner, instead of monetary return.
