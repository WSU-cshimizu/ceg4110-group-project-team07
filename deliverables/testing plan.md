# Testing Plan 

We will concentrate on a few essential elements of testing:
  - Unit Testing: To examine certain components of our system, such as functions or classes.
  - Integration Testing: To guarantee that the various components of our system (frontend, backend, and API) operate properly together.
  - Functional Testing: To ensure that the system performs as expected for the user.
  - End-to-End Testing: To recreate real-world scenarios and guarantee that everything runs properly from beginning to end.
  - API Testing: Ensuring that the API processes requests successfully and provides the intended results.

# Testing Framework: 
   - We use the BDD (Behavior Driven Development) framework alongside with Cucumber for automation. 
   - This framework allows us to write tests in plain English, which the entire team can comprehend. 
   - It fits wonderfully with our development strategy because it keeps developers, testers, and even 
   non-technical stakeholders on the same page.

# Justification for the Plan:
  - This testing strategy fits our whole software development strategy because we are using Agile methodology, 
     which emphasizes regular feedback and incremental changes.
  - BDD testing works easily with Agile, allowing us to test continually and identify problems early.
  - Furthermore, by developing tests in simple language with Cucumber,  
     any team members, technical or not, may contribute to and understand the testing process.

# Justification for the Framework: 
  - BDD with Cucumber is feasible due to its extensive documentation and supportive community.  
  - It's also versatile enough to handle both frontend and backend testing, as well as API testing,  
   making it an all-around pick for our project.
  - It thoroughly evaluates the system by focusing on user behavior and ensuring that it performs as predicted under numerous conditions. The framework 
   is an ideal solution for our project because it matches our process and enables for simple collaboration.
