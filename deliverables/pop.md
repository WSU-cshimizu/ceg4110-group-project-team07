# TEAm07 - Project Overview Proposal
_____________________________________

## Elevator Pitch

Team07's PROJECT NAME will help people connect with others by allowing them to navigate easily. Small landmarks are common but often lack a name or address. Such locations can be difficult to find using other navigation technologies. Our project will solve this problem by using an image search to provide directions to user-submitted locations. These directions can be sent to friends so people can find each other quickly.This solution offers a streamlined, interactive way to manage memories and tasks tied to physical locations, improving productivity and user experience.
## N "Things of Complexity" (4 students - 4 sections)

  1. **Frontend Development (Angular)-Anna Crafton**

     - Developing the UI using Angular is flexible for incorporating the components for uploading the images, videos, location details, Comments and user profile management. Also by integrating the Google Maps API to display locations and offers an interactive experience for navigation. The frontend developer will also handle HTTP communication with the backend and manage application's state and design.

  2. **Backend Development (Java with Springboot)-Gokulnaath Govindaraj**

     - Building and Maintaining the Restful API using java with Spring Boot. This includes user authentication, Commuinication between client and server, and CRUD operations. Also integrating the Google Maps API. Here the integration refers to the support for frontend by handling data processing, security, and additional logic related to navigation and directions.

  3. **Database Management (MySql)-Jennesa Sparks**    

     - Managing the database using MySql to store user data, comments, images and location information. The developer will design efficient database to support data retrieval and manupulation.
     
  5. **API Integration and Testing (GraphQL Integration)-Prabesh Bhattarai**

     - This developer is responsible on integrating the GraphQL to provide flexible data querying. Aslo performing testing of both RESTful and GraphQL APIs to maintaint the best communication between frontend and backend. 
     
## Componets-Architecture
   
The application will follow a three-tier architecture:

We predict, based on initial analysis, that we will implement a three-tier architecture. This will include a front-end, back-end, and a database. The front-end client will use RESTful APIs to interact with the back-end server. The back-end server will handle logic and connect to the database to store and manage data. The API will be crucial to maintaining efficient communication between the client, server, and database.

  1. **Frontend (Angular):**  
     - Handles all user interactions, displaying data fetched from the backend via REST APIs, and providing an interface to manage notes, locations, and user profiles. The integration with Google Maps API allows users to see the direction and handle real time interaction.
    
  2. **Backend (Java with Spring Boot):**  
     - Provides the business logic, handling CRUD operations, authentication, and integration with Google Maps API to support the frontend operations and dataprocessing. It serves as the intermediary between the frontend and the database.
    
  3. **Database (MySQL):**  
     - Database is to store the informations like images videos and notes to be stored and the gps information as well.

## Languages / Technology
  
  1. **Frontend-Angular**:
     - **Why?** This is a powerful tool with large active community and sources to refer while in development. This makes it the best choice for developing the single page application. Also the developer has some previous experince in this framework.
  2. **Backend-Java with Spring Boot**:  
     - **Why?** Java with Spring Boot is Chosen for its flexiblity, scalablity, vast libraries, and community. Developer who is going to work in this step has prior experience.
  3. **Database-MySql**

     - **Why?** It is easy for maintaing the database also integration with Java via Spring Data JPA will be easy work compared to other techniques like MyBatis and JDBC which requires loads of manual work.
  
  4. **API-GraphQL**

      - **Why?** For a website this framework will be useful for obtaining the exact data needed which improves the performance and reduce the payload.
  
  5. **Google Maps API**

      -**Why?** This is selected for its reliablity, rich feature set and sources of documentation. This setup is not complicated. 

## Life Cycle and Methodology

Agile Methodology will give our team flexibility and short-term deadlines to ensure consistent progress, as well as make sure the team communicates problems effectively and quickly.

Sprints will be one week to twelve days depending on the complexity of the task we are working on. This length allows us to keep meetings on Tuesdays or Thursdays, which makes it more likely the whole group can attend meetings, and is also short enough to ensure flexible and consistent updates.

Scrum will consist of in-person meetings after class or virtual meetings on Outlook between sprints and as needed for problem-solving. We will also use email and text to keep organized and in touch, to discuss the project, and to plan our next steps.
