# Software Development Plan

## Communication Plan

* Meeting Location(s)
  * We will hold meetings in two different places for in-person collaboration:
 	- Fawcett Hall Classroom, 
	- Library
  * For Virtual meetings we will be using Teams.
  
* Meeting Time(s)
  * Meetings will be conducted immediately after class and virtually as needed. For all virtual meetings, the RSVP link will be mailed at least 12 hrs. before the meeting time.
  
* Meeting Cadence
  * We plan to meet Weekly or Bi-Weekly on Tuesdays and Thursdays after class.
  
* Communication mechanism(s) for outside of meetings
  * We anticipate communicating through Email and Instagram outside of meetings, committed to responding to messages within one day. 

**Justification:**
  Our team consists of two graduate and two undergraduate members, so the perfect time for our meetings without time conflicts will be after classes, from 12:30 to 1:30. Since we will be at the university until 6:00 PM, we might also reschedule the meeting if everyone is available before then. In case of any scheduling clashes, we will use Microsoft Meet. The meeting link will be sent to team members once the time is finalized.

We chose the library as our meeting area because it is close to our classroom at Fawcett Hall, and it has a group study area where we can discuss without disturbances. For virtual communication, we use Instagram and Microsoft Teams. Everyone has an Instagram account and is active there, and Teams is useful for recording meetings, as we all have Microsoft accounts.

**Justification for Timeline **

Database initialization is first since all other aspects of our project rely on it existing before they can be completed. This phase lasts 12 days to allow time to discuss the necessary contents of the database and an additional week to write/debug the script.
 
Requirement specifications, testing plans, and design specifications are early on in the plan to make sure everyone has a good idea of how components should work. They are staggard over two weeks to allow adjustments to previous documents as the plan develops, and because it will allow time to ensure the whole team can meet and discuss each one. 

Basic front-end and API integration will last 7 days to create a basic user interface/website. An additional 3 days at the end will be dedicated to the API. These 3 days will be staggard with the Backend to allow developers to work together. The backend will have an additional two weeks after these 3 days since it will require a substantial amount of work. 

User Authentication will take place over ten days during the second half of frontend/backend development. The time allotted is long enough to allow meetings since multiple team members will work together closely on this aspect. 

Frontend development will happen at the same time as the backend. Since the basic front end has already been completed, these two weeks are for completing the user interface and ensuring the front end and back end can communicate effectively with each other and the database. 


Manual testing and Debugging last a week to make sure individual components work well alone. It is followed by a longer debugging and testing period of two weeks to make sure the components work well together and to user-proof the project. 

Finalizing the MVP will take only a few days since the project should be done by this point, but may need some time for emergency changes.

Updates and improvements are after the final MVP. This phase lasts one week because this stage should only consist of minor adjustments for aesthetic or quality-of-life purposes, so it should not take very long.
