# TEAm07 - Project Overview Proposal
_____________________________________

## Elevator Pitch

Team07's PROJECT NAME will help people connect with others by allowing them to navigate easily. Small landmarks are common but often lack a name or address. Such locations can be difficult to find using other navigation technologies. Our project will solve this problem by using an image search to provide directions to user-submitted locations. These directions can be sent to friends so people can find each other quickly.
