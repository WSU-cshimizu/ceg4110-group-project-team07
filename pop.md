# TEAm07 - Project Overview Proposal
_____________________________________

## Elevator Pitch

Team07's PROJECT NAME will help people connect with others by allowing them to navigate easily. Small landmarks are common but often lack a name or address. Such locations can be difficult to find using other navigation technologies. Our project will solve this problem by using an image search to provide directions to user-submitted locations. These directions can be sent to friends so people can find each other quickly.

## Life Cycle and Methodology

Agile Methodology will give our team flexibility and short-term deadlines to ensure consistent progress, as well as make sure the team communicates problems effectively and quickly.

Sprints will be one week to twelve days depending on the complexity of the task we are working on. This length allows us to keep meetings on Tuesdays or Thursdays, which makes it more likely the whole group can attend meetings, and is also short enough to ensure flexible and consistent updates.

Scrum will consist of in-person meetings after class or virtual meetings on Outlook between sprints and as needed for problem-solving. We will also use email and text to keep organized and in touch, to discuss the project, and to plan our next steps.
